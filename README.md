# Turtle Race
Make your bet. Which turtle will win the race?

Moduls: turtle, random

This is an easy example, how can we use Graphical User Interface (GUI) in Python.

Here is a classic game where six turtles will compete (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple). If you hit run, the first time the program will ask you, take your bet. You can type the color, for example: "red". Then click ok.

All turtles going to stand up on the start line, and will going to move immedietly until the another side. You don't need to press any key on keyboard, program will controls all six turtles in the same time.

If red turtle will win, you can see the notification in the console: "You've won! The red turtle is the winner!"

Else:

"You've lost! The {winning_color} turtle is the winner!"

(Program will write, which color of turtle was the winner.)
